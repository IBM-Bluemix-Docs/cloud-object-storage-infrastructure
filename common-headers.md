# Common headers

## Common Request Headers

The following table describes supported common request headers. {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}} ignores any common headers that are not listed in the table, if they are sent in a request. Although, some requests might support other headers as defined in this documentation. For more information about creating the authorization header, see ["Authentication"](manage-access.html#authentication).


| Header             | Note                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `Authorization`      | **Required** for all requests (AWS Signature Version 4).   |
| `Host`               | **Required** for all requests.                 |
| `x-amz-date`         | **Required** for all requests. Can also be specified as `Date`.               |
| `x-amz-content-sha256`| **Required** for uploading objects or any request with information in the body. |
| `Content-Length`     | **Required** for uploading objects, chunked encoding also supported.    |
| `Content-MD5`        | A 128-bit MD5 hash value of the request body being sent.                  |
| `Expect`             | `100-continue` waits for the headers to be accepted before sending the body.  |
| `Cache-Control` | Can be used to specify caching behavior along the request/reply chain. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9 |
