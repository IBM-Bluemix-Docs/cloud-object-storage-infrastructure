# {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} in the IBM Cloud

{{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} is storage for the cloud. Essentially, it is a key-value store, where files (or any binary data) are given an identifying key (or name), and are stored as an 'object' in a uniquely named 'bucket' or 'container'. This feature allows for highly scalable storage where the only information you need to retrieve your data is the name of the object and the bucket where it is stored.
