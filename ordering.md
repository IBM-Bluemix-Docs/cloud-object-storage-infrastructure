# Ordering {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} (Classic)

Until recently, IBM offered Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service in two distinct environments. The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Platform provided a robust application development platform with direct access to cutting edge IBM technologies and DevOps services. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Infrastructure provided access to infrastructure services, such as bare metal or virtual servers, data storage, and networking.

## Creating an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account

Before you can order a storage account, it is necessary to create a customer account first.

1. Go to [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com){: new_window} and click the **Create a Free Account** button.
2. Complete the form, by providing your email address, name, region, and phone number. Choose a password.
3. Follow the link provided by the confirmation email, and follow the links to log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}.
4. Before you can use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, you need to set up a basic development environment. Choose a region based on your geographic location, and choose a name for your organization. Don't worry about being perfect - you can change it or create more organizations later. Follow the **Create** link.
5. Now you need to name your first development space. This name can be changed at any time. After you chose a name, follow the **Create** link.
6. Follow the **I'm Ready** link to get started with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}.
7. Ordering infrastructure services requires upgrading to a Pay-As-You-Go account. Upgraded accounts still receive runtime and service allowances, and are only charged for resources that were used. Go to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} catalog, and follow the link for **Cloud Object Storage - S3 API**.
8. Follow the **Upgrade** link.
9. Complete the Contact and Billing information forms, check the box to acknowledge Cloud Service terms, and follow the **Submit Order** link.
10. Follow the **Done** link, and wait for an email that confirms your account upgrade.

You can archive rarely accessed data. Archive works with existing storage-class tiers, as a result, you can reduce storage costs even further by storing data offline with our lowest-priced storage. For more information, see [Archiving data](/docs/infrastructure/cloud-object-storage-infrastructure?topic=cloud-object-storage-infrastructure-archiving-data).
